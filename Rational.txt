Hmm, I think there are some things I should outline for the direction of this language.

My thinking is that everything will be an object built out of other objects or the primitive object, an int.

I think the code will be cross complied into python, that seems to be the easiest way to implement this language.


Syntax is going to be very pythonic, though I want static typing.

Object Archetecture:

Object:
	Properties
	Functions


Syntactic Rules:

Defining an Object:
	

type	#name{

	#type1 #tname1	
	#type2 #tname2	
	
	#type3 func #fname1 (#type #arg, #type #arg){
	
	}
}
